A floated element is taken out of the normal 
flow and shifted to the left or right as far as possible in the space available of the containing element.
Other elements normally flow around the floated items, unless they are prevented from doing so by their clear property. 
Elements are floated horizontally, which means that an element can only be floated left or right, 
not up or down.</p>
